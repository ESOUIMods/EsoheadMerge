##0.1.9

Features
- Added new slash command "/esomerge ignore on" to ignore non English Map Names.  This is only available with the English client.[2]
- Added new slash command "/esomerge prep" to delete unneeded nodes not related to HarvestMap.[1]  

[1] This is only intended to be used on the Daily Merge files and other files you intend to use with HarvestMap.  The intent of EsoheadMerge is still to backup and consolidate all the data you want.
[2] Keep in mind that this is just for sharing with others when the file is too large.  HarvestMap imports all maps and translates the map name whenever possible.  This is only to help reduce the file size as needed.  I will be added translation routines after I have a larger data base of Map names in all three languages.
